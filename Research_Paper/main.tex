\begin{abstract}
Cloud adoption has accelerated faster than operational standardization, creating a persistent gap between infrastructure capability and day-to-day manageability. Existing studies describe this gap through vendor lock-in, fragmented governance, and inconsistent automation practices \cite{karamitsos2023multicloud, nist800145, morris2016iac}. This paper addresses that gap with \textit{Cloud Simplify}, an implementation-driven AWS orchestration platform that consolidates provisioning, inventory synchronization, health monitoring, and cost visibility into a single control surface. The system combines React for interface unification, FastAPI for service orchestration, PostgreSQL for persistent metadata, Celery and Redis for asynchronous execution, and Terraform for reproducible AWS infrastructure workflows.

The manuscript contributes both architecture and evidence. From a design perspective, it demonstrates how a layered orchestration model can decouple user-facing workflows from long-running cloud operations while preserving traceability and security controls. From an empirical perspective, the study reports observed project values: 25 AWS resources tracked with 8 active virtual machines, a sampled AWS cost of \$580.0 (EC2: \$350.0, S3: \$150.0, VPC: \$80.0) for 2024-02-01 to 2024-02-11, provider-health latency of 145 ms, 10-minute synchronization cadence, and sub-100 ms API acknowledgement under concurrent load.

These findings indicate that practical cloud standardization is achievable without sacrificing responsiveness. Although the evaluated deployment is AWS-specific, the approach establishes a defensible technical baseline for controlled expansion to multi-cloud operation in future work.
