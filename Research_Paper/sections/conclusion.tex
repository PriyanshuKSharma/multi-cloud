This paper demonstrated \textit{Cloud Simplify}, a unified orchestration platform that successfully addresses the fragmentation of the multi-cloud ecosystem. By combining the power of Terraform with a reactive FastAPI backend, we provide a solution that simplifies cloud management while maintaining high security and performance. The architecture presented provides a foundation for more advanced AI-driven features, paving the way for autonomous cloud infrastructure that adapts to business needs in real-time.
