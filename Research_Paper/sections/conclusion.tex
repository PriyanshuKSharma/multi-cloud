This document has presented \textit{Cloud Simplify} as a unified orchestration approach to mitigate dependency on individual cloud service providers. By introducing a provider-agnostic abstraction built on Infrastructure as Code, we facilitate the democratization of cloud platforms, enabling organizations to achieve true vendor independence.

Our implementation demonstrates that standardizing provisioning, security, and cost governance across AWS, Azure, and GCP is technically feasible and strategically imperative \cite{gartner2024multicloud}. As an explorative proposal, this work highlights the path toward an autonomous, portable infrastructure ecosystem that aligns with NIST and ISO/IEC standards \cite{nist500292, iso17788}. Future research will focus on deeper AI-driven governance and broader provider support, furthering the vision of a resilient, multi-cloud future.
