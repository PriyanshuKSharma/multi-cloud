This paper presented \textit{Cloud Simplify} as an AWS-focused orchestration platform that standardizes infrastructure provisioning, monitoring, and cost visibility through a unified control plane. By combining FastAPI, Celery, Redis, PostgreSQL, and Terraform, the implementation demonstrates that cloud operations can be made significantly more consistent without increasing user-side complexity.

The reported results show practical value: regular 10-minute synchronization, measurable provider health telemetry, consolidated cost breakdowns, and asynchronous provisioning behavior that preserves fast API interaction. These outcomes validate the central thesis that operational standardization is achievable with an implementation-driven approach.

Although the current evaluated deployment is AWS-specific, the architecture is intentionally designed for future provider expansion. Subsequent work will focus on risk-hardening, policy enforcement, and controlled extension to Azure and GCP once AWS baseline reliability goals are fully stabilized.
