Future enhancements for Cloud Simplify include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Auto-Healing Infrastructure}: Implementing a feedback loop where the platform automatically detects a resource failure and triggers a "terraform apply" to restore the desired state.
    \item \textbf{Cross-Cloud Migration}: A feature to automatically migrate workloads between AWS and Azure based on real-time cost-saving opportunities or regional latency changes.
    \item \textbf{Websocket-Based Live Logs}: Moving from polling to real-time streaming of Terraform execution logs to the frontend.
\end{itemize}
