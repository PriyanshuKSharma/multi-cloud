\subsection{Future Scope: Risk and Challenge Management}
In the current project phase, risk and challenge handling is treated as a future-scope engineering roadmap rather than a standalone evaluated section. The planned roadmap includes:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{State Integrity Controls}: move Terraform state to hardened remote backends (S3 + locking strategy) with recovery workflows for interrupted runs.
    \item \textbf{Credential Governance}: automated rotation windows, least-privilege IAM templates, and audit trails for key usage.
    \item \textbf{Failure-Oriented Testing}: periodic chaos and rollback drills for worker failures, API outages, and partial applies.
    \item \textbf{Policy Enforcement}: policy-as-code checks before apply to block non-compliant infrastructure configurations.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Functional Enhancements}
Planned product extensions include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{WebSocket Live Logs}: real-time Terraform and sync logs streamed directly to the frontend.
    \item \textbf{Automated Cost Advisories}: recommendation engine for idle resources and right-sizing opportunities.
    \item \textbf{Cross-Cloud Expansion}: Azure and GCP provider modules reintroduced after AWS baseline hardening.
\end{itemize}
