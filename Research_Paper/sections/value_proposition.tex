Cloud Simplify provides a multi-faceted value proposition by standardizing multi-cloud operations and enabling strategic flexibility.

\subsection{Breaking Vendor Lock-In}
The primary value of Cloud Simplify is the elimination of single-provider dependency. By deploying identical infrastructure across multiple providers, organizations can migrate workloads with minimal re-engineering, mitigate risks from provider roadmap decisions, and negotiate from a position of relative strength \cite{karamitsos2023multicloud}.

\subsection{Cost Optimization through Arbitrage}
Multi-cloud environments enable organizations to leverage competitive pricing across providers \cite{mckinsey2023costs}. Cloud Simplify facilitates:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Regional Optimization}: Selecting providers with the lowest costs in target deployment regions.
    \item \textbf{Egress Cost Reduction}: Utilizing lowest-cost data transfer routes across heterogeneous clouds.
    \item \textbf{Capacity Arbitrage}: Comparing and selecting providers with optimal spot or reserved pricing for specific workloads.
\end{itemize}
Enterprises often achieve 15--30\% cost reductions through such optimized deployment strategies \cite{flexera2024}.

\subsection{Operational Standardization}
By providing consistent workflows across development, staging, and production, Cloud Simplify eliminates configuration drift and reduces human error. Table \ref{tab:time_comp} illustrates the acceleration in time-to-value compared to traditional provider-specific provisioning.
