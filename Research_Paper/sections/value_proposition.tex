Cloud Simplify's primary value in the current phase is operational standardization for AWS workloads. Instead of switching between service-specific tools, teams execute provisioning, monitoring, and cost inspection from one API-aligned workflow.

\subsection{AWS Operational Consolidation}
In conventional AWS usage, infrastructure teams alternate between the EC2 console, S3 console, VPC dashboard, Cost Explorer, and custom scripts. Cloud Simplify unifies these actions behind a single orchestration path and common status model. This reduces context switching and makes operational outcomes easier to audit.

\subsection{Cost and Governance Visibility}
The platform integrates cost and inventory records so engineering decisions can be linked directly to spend \cite{mckinsey2023costs, flexera2024}. Instead of exporting reports manually, users access consolidated cost data through dashboard and billing endpoints, enabling faster governance decisions.

\subsection{Operational Standardization with Real Project Data}
Table \ref{tab:time_comp} compares traditional AWS operation patterns against observed Cloud Simplify behavior from the implemented project.

\hline
\textbf{Operational Activity} & \textbf{Traditional AWS Workflow} & \textbf{Cloud Simplify (Observed Project Data)} \\ \hline
Inventory freshness & Console or CLI checks done manually, often a few times per day. & Automated sync runs every 10 minutes using Celery (\texttt{sync\_all\_users\_resources}) with manual trigger support. \\ \hline
Provider health tracking & Manual connectivity verification and service-level checks. & AWS health stored in \texttt{provider\_health}; sample response latency recorded as 145 ms. \\ \hline
Deployment acknowledgement & Operator-driven confirmation via console/CLI; process-dependent delays. & API acknowledgement remains below 100 ms with 10 concurrent requests while provisioning runs asynchronously. \\ \hline
Cost consolidation & Manual Cost Explorer navigation and spreadsheet aggregation. & Unified billing API reports AWS service split (EC2 \$350.0, S3 \$150.0, VPC \$80.0; total \$580.0 for 2024-02-01 to 2024-02-11). \\ \hline
Lifecycle tracking & Status checked separately per AWS service console. & Single resource endpoint tracks \texttt{pending} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{provisioning} $\rightarrow$ \texttt{active}; sample VM completed in 5 minutes. \\ \hline
