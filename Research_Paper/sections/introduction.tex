The rapid shift toward cloud-native architectures has led organizations to adopt multi-cloud strategies to ensure high availability, cost optimization, and regional compliance. However, the lack of a standardized interface across leading Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) has introduced significant interoperability challenges. Developers are often burdened with mastering multiple vendor-specific consoles and APIs, leading to slower deployment cycles and increased risk of configuration drift.

In this context, Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) has emerged as a critical paradigm, allowing infrastructure to be defined and versioned through declarative configuration files. While tools like Terraform provide the underlying engine for cross-provider provisioning, there remains a gap in providing a user-centric, SaaS-based orchestration layer that abstracts these complexities for non-expert users while maintaining the robustness required for production environments.

This research introduces \textit{Cloud Simplify}, a unified multi-cloud orchestration platform. Cloud Simplify offers a "Single Pane of Glass" dashboard that unifies the provisioning of Virtual Machines (VMs) and Object Storage across multiple CSPs. By leveraging an asynchronous, event-driven architecture powered by FastAPI, Redis, and Celery, the platform ensures that heavy infrastructure operations do not block the user interface. This paper details the architecture, implementation, and future AI-driven enhancements of the platform, demonstrating its viability as a scalable solution for modern cloud management.
