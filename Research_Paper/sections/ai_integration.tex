While the current implementation focus on robust provisioning, the "Intelligent Plane" of Cloud Simplify is designed for proactive infrastructure management.

\subsection{Predictive Resource Sizing}
Using historical performance metrics (CPU utilization, memory pressure), the platform integrates a lightweight regression model to recommend optimal instance types \cite{researchgate_ml_2025}. This prevents the common problem of over-provisioning, which leads to unnecessary cloud expenditure \cite{cost_optim_2025}. For example, the system can detect if an \text{m5.large} instance is consistently under-utilized and suggest a downgrade to \text{t3.medium}.

\subsection{Anomaly Detection in Cloud Utilization}
The integration layer monitors usage patterns across all configured accounts \cite{ijsat_ai_2024}. By applying unsupervised learning (Isolation Forests), the platform can identify anomalous spikes in resource consumption, which may indicate security breaches (e.g., unauthorized crypto-mining) or misconfigured deployment scripts.

\subsection{Smart Cost Optimization}
The platform leverages generative AI to analyze multi-cloud billing documents \cite{cost_optim_2025}. By correlating resource tags with cost data, it provides natural language summaries of "orphaned" resources (e.g., unattached EBS volumes or unused elastic IPs) that should be terminated to save costs \cite{hashicorp_sentinel_2024}.

\subsection{Resource Mapping and Abstraction}
To ensure interoperability, Cloud Simplify maintains a mapping layer that translates high-level service requests into provider-specific parameters. Table \ref{tab:mapping} illustrates this abstraction for common compute and storage resources.
