The platform is containerized with Docker Compose, allowing reproducible deployment for development and controlled staging environments.

\subsection{Deployment Workflow}
Deployment begins with \texttt{docker-compose up --build}, which starts the frontend, backend API, PostgreSQL, Redis, and Celery worker within an isolated internal network. This pattern provides deterministic service startup and simplifies environment replication.

\subsection{Current Production Scope: AWS}
The currently validated provisioning path is AWS-specific. Resource synchronization, health checks, and cost aggregation are operational for AWS resources (EC2, S3, VPC), and Terraform execution paths are configured around AWS modules. This scoped deployment strategy keeps implementation reliability high while additional provider integrations are matured.

\subsection{Scalability Direction}
The architecture scales horizontally at worker layer. As infrastructure demand increases, additional Celery workers can be attached to the Redis queue, allowing parallel provisioning without degrading synchronous API responsiveness.
