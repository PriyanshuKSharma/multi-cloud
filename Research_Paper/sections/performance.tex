\subsection{Working Explanation of Table \ref{tab:aws_real_values}}
Table \ref{tab:aws_real_values} shows that standardization benefits are achieved through three mechanisms. First, \textbf{time regularity}: the 10-minute sync cadence ensures inventory freshness without manual intervention. Second, \textbf{responsive control plane}: API calls return quickly while heavy provisioning is delegated to Celery workers, preserving user experience during infrastructure changes. Third, \textbf{unified visibility}: resource counts, health latency, and service-level costs are available in one interface, replacing service-by-service console navigation.

The cost row is especially important operationally. Instead of reviewing AWS services independently, the platform provides a single consolidated view for the evaluated period (2024-02-01 to 2024-02-11), enabling direct comparison between compute (EC2), storage (S3), and network-related spend (VPC). This is the key evidence that Cloud Simplify converts raw AWS telemetry into actionable governance signals.

\subsection{Provisioning Overhead and Throughput}
Observed results indicate that orchestration overhead remains small relative to provider execution time. The asynchronous queue architecture keeps frontend/API interactions fast while Terraform execution proceeds in worker context. This aligns with prior orchestration benchmarks that report queue and coordination overhead as secondary to cloud-side resource provisioning latency \cite{terraform_performance_2023, wjarr2024}.
