To evaluate the effectiveness of the Cloud Simplify platform, we conducted performance testing focusing on provisioning latency and system responsiveness during concurrent operations.

\subsection{Provisioning Latency}
We measured the time from the user's "Deploy" click to the resource being fully active in the cloud provider. 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{AWS S3}: Avg. 12 seconds.
    \item \textbf{Azure VM}: Avg. 145 seconds.
    \item \textbf{GCP Storage}: Avg. 10 seconds.
\end{itemize}
The results demonstrate that the overhead introduced by Cloud Simplify (task queueing and module preparation) is negligible ($<$2 seconds) compared to the provider's execution time \cite{terraform_performance_2023}. These findings align with recent benchmarks for large-scale multi-cloud deployments \cite{wjarr2024}.

\subsection{System Throughput}
By leveraging Celery with multiple workers, we tested the platform's ability to handle concurrent provisioning. With 10 concurrent requests, the API response time remained below 100ms, proving the efficiency of the asynchronous architecture \cite{wjarr2024}.

\subsection{Security Effectiveness}
Zero credentials were found in plain-text logs or in the frontend application state during vulnerability scanning (OWASP ZAP), verifying the effectiveness of our encryption layers.
